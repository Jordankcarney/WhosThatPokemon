A simple game where you guess which Pokemon is shown. Simply open the web page and start typing.

Planned features:
  - Blacked out image to be more in line with the older telivision series episode's transitions
  - Generation selection
  - Reset button
  - Timer limit per pokemon
  - loading animation
  
Known bugs:
  - Some pokemon have hyphens in their names.

If you type 'cheatson' in the input field it will display the name registered with the Pokemon displayed, but that's no fun.
